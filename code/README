# The code for the Dual-core Processor simulator starts at 'main.c'. 

# * README *
# Current file with the instructions to start the project; you can run this
# file as a script to quickly set everything up: `source ./README` You can find
# the lab instructions are online.
sudo apt install make -y
sudo apt install gcc -y

# 5. Test build.
gcc main.c -D_REENTRANT -lpthread

# 5. Test run.
#     ./executable -c <configuration_file.txt> -n <amount_instruction_1> -o <arq_path_destiny_1> -p <instruction_file_1.txt> -m <amount_instructions_2> -q <arq_path_destiny_2> -r <instruction_file_2.txt>
#     <-c >       - archive of config (time/latencia) (txt)
#     <-n >       - number of program instructions one
#     <-m >       - number of program instruction two 
#     <-o > 	  - output file one, will have the results of the tables in each clock of the execution (txt)
#     <-q >       - output file two, will have the results of the tables in each clock of the execution (txt)
#     <-p > 	  - instruction file one (txt - no comments just the line instructions)
#     <-r >       - instruction file two (txt - no comments just the line instructions)

# Example for a test already saved in the current directories
./a.out -c ./examples/config.txt -n 7 -p ./examples/mnemoniosRAR.txt -o testePthread1.txt -m 7 -r ./examples/mnemoniosRAW.txt -q testePthread2.txt


# 6. Add your own settings and instructions and run!
